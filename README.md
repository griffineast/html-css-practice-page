# html-css-practice-page
In this project I refreshed my basic html and css knowledge.

This is a basic website built using HTML and CSS to store helpful information about different HTML and CSS topics. The website contains one page: index.html.

Getting Started
To view the website, simply open the index.html in your web browser. You can also host the website on a web server to make it accessible online.

Pages
index.html
This page contains information about HTML tags and their usage. It also includes examples of common HTML tags, presented in a table format.
